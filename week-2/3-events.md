### How can OpenSea quickly determine which NFTs an address owns if most NFTs donâ€™t use ERC721 enumerable. Explain how you would accomplish this if you were creating an NFT marketplace

If NFT is ERC721-compliant, then all mint and transfer operations will emit an event. In that case, all I need to do is to listen for those events and track the ownership of each tokenId.

If I would do it in NodeJS, I could create a in-memory mapping (or a persistent storage Redis):
```js
const token_id_to_owner = {}; // mapping(tokenId => address)
```

Then I would look through past `Transfer` events and would listen to future `Transfer` events.

On each `Transfer` event
```sol
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
```
I would update the mapping
```js
token_id_to_owner[_tokenId] = _to;
```


If the contract is not ERC721, then there can not be a general solution to this and the solution will depend on the implementation of the contract.
