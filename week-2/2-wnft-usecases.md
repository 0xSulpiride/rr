# Wrapped NFT usecases

1) Wrapped NFTs can be used to upgrade of underlying NFT, for example, to change the metadata of an existing NFT or to add royalties.

2) Wrapped NFTs can be used to represent an NFT as an ERC20 where each token represents a share of the NFT that then can be sold or used as a collateral
